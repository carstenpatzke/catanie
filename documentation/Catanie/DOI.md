# Getting a DOI with SciCat

In the scicat shopping cart, you have the option to publish a dataset with a DOI.
For this to work you need to have an account with a DataCite DOI registry.

https://search.datacite.org/data-centers

They will give you a username and password which you can then configure in scicat, in 

In catamel/server/doiconfig.local.json
{"username":"<insert datacite user>","password":"<insert datacite password>"}
